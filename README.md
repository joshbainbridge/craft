This is an independent project which aims to find best practice within visual graphics technology and cross platform development. It currently supports Windows and OS X platforms but should compile on Linux (not tested).

Currently the project resembles a procedural 2D/3D platform game. The controls are Arrows + WASD but can be configured within the source.

Required dependencies are:

* CMake 2.8
* OpenGL 3.3 (Mavericks required on OS X)
* GLFW 3.0
* GLM
* GLEW (Windows only)
* Boost (Not yet required)
* Awesomium (Not yet required)
