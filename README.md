Craft Game:
=======

This repository is for an indpendent and experemental game called Craft. It is experimental in both style and procedrual gameplay blending between two and three dimensional worlds with varying detail and colour. Techniques such as instancing, octree data structures and procedrual noise have been implemented. Currently the controls are just Arrows + WASD keys and the source should compile on Windows, Mac and Linux.
